# Refactoring Guide

Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without altering its external behavior. The primary goal of refactoring is to improve the internal structure and design of the code, making it more readable, maintainable, and adaptable to future requirements.

Refactoring can help resolve issues like long methods, non-representative names, and complex structures. This guide covers the key refactoring techniques that can be applied to different code scenarios.

## Why Refactor?

Refactoring offers several benefits:

- **Improves Readability**: Cleaner code is easier to understand and maintain.
- **Enhances Design**: Better-structured code is more adaptable to change.
- **Increases Reusability**: Properly organized code can be reused across different parts of the application.
- **Simplifies Maintenance**: Clear and concise code makes it easier to identify and fix bugs or add new features.

Refactoring is often needed when:

- Methods are too long or complex.
- Variable or method names are not descriptive or representative.
- Classes or methods are doing more than one thing (lack of single responsibility).

## Common Refactoring Techniques

### Extract Method
Identify a block of code within a method and move it to a separate, named method. This helps reduce method complexity and promotes reusability.

### Extract Variable
Isolate expressions into separate variables to clarify their purpose and improve readability.

### Inline Temp
Replace temporary variables with direct method calls or expressions, reducing unnecessary variable declarations and simplifying the code.

## Organizing Classes and Methods

### Moving Features Between Objects
When a class has too many responsibilities, consider moving methods and fields to other classes to achieve a better separation of concerns.

#### Move Method and Field
- Move a method or field from one class to another when its primary purpose is more related to the other class.

#### Extract Class
- Create a new class from existing fields and methods when a class is handling too many concerns. This new class can encapsulate related behavior and data.

### Organizing Data
Properly organized data and associated classes are more portable and reusable. This can be achieved through techniques like:

- **Encapsulate Fields and Collections**: Make fields private and provide controlled access through properties or methods.
- **Replace Magic Numbers with Constants**: Replace hard-coded values with named constants to increase readability and understanding.
- **Change Type Fields with Class**: Replace primitive type fields with a class if they represent a distinct concept or entity.

## Simplifying Code

### Simplifying Conditional Expressions
Refactor complex conditional logic to enhance clarity and readability:

- **Consolidate Conditional Expressions**: Combine multiple `if` conditions that lead to the same outcome.
- **Consolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments**: Extract repeated code from `if` branches into separate methods or variables.
- **Decompose Conditionals**: Break down long conditional statements into smaller, self-explanatory methods.

### Simplifying Method Calls
Make method calls easier to understand and use:

- **Preserve Whole Object**: Pass entire objects as parameters rather than passing individual fields.
- **Introduce Parameter Object**: Group multiple parameters into a single object to simplify method signatures.
- **Split and Merge Methods**: Split methods that handle multiple responsibilities or merge methods that share a common purpose.

## Dealing with Generalization

### Moving Functionality Along the Class Inheritance Hierarchy
Adjust the placement of fields and methods within a class hierarchy:

- **Pull Up Fields and Methods**: Move shared fields or methods from subclasses to a superclass.
- **Pull Down Fields and Methods**: Move specialized fields or methods from a superclass to a subclass.

### Extract Interface, Subclass, or Superclass
- **Extract Interface**: Create an interface when multiple classes share common behavior but differ in implementation.
- **Extract Subclass**: Create a subclass when part of a class’s functionality can be isolated.
- **Extract Superclass**: Create a superclass when multiple classes have overlapping behavior or fields.

## Renaming Elements

Consistent and meaningful naming is crucial. Use your IDE’s built-in functionality to rename classes, methods, fields, or variables to ensure consistency throughout your codebase.

- **Use IDE Functionality**: IDEs often provide tools for safe renaming that update references across the entire codebase.
- **Manual Renaming**: If renaming manually, be cautious to update all occurrences and dependencies to avoid breaking the code.

By applying these refactoring techniques, you can transform your code into a cleaner, more structured, and maintainable version of itself. Refactoring is an ongoing process that should be performed regularly to keep your codebase in optimal condition.
